unittest1 works
unittest2 works

unittest4 works
bug1.c
cardtest1.c works

cardtest3.c works
cardtest4c.works

not working:

unittest3 - just need to fix garden card
cardtest2 - incomplete

TO ENHANCE:

unittest4 - don't just test return values, test state of game after isGameOver
cardtest4 - figure out how to accurately test card being discarded, even if same card is drawn after discard
all - consider refactoring so that position corresponds to a reference to the hand rather than a hard-coded integer
